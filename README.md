# setup-waypoint

This action sets up Waypoint for use by other actions by
installing and configuring the CLI to communicate with an external
Waypoint server.

This action is a building block for using Waypoint with
GitHub Actions. If you are interested in automatically deploying,
annotating, and releasing with Waypoint and GitHub actions,
see the experimental [hashicorp/action-waypoint](https://github.com/hashicorp/action-waypoint) action, 
which uses this one as a dependency.

Waypoint must be running in server mode on a network that the GitHub actions
runner can communciate with for this action to be used.

For more information, see the documentation on 
integrating [GitHub Actions with Waypoint](https://waypointproject.io/docs/automating-execution/github-actions).
